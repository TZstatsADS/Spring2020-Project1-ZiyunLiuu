### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: What can we know from the change of Rock music lyrics? 
+ This project is conducted by Ziyun Liu

+ Project summary: In this project, I will discuss about the relationship between the popularity of Rock music and Rock music lyrics. There are 3 mean parts. First, I explored the data to see the trend of Rock music. Then I discussed the relationship based on two sub parts - words and sentiments or lyrics. Finally, I did a short summary.
